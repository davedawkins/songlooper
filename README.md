### Main Application Components

- main.py - Entry point that creates the application.
- app.py - Core application class that initializes the components and manages the overall application state.

### UI Modules

- ui/slider_view.py - The slider component with markers that you specifically wanted to isolate. This has been extracted as a self-contained module that handles all playback position visualization and marker dragging.
- ui/song_selection.py - Handles selecting and loading songs.
- ui/section_controls.py - Manages section creation, editing, and deletion.
- ui/playback_controls.py - Controls for playback speed, looping, and count-in features.
- ui/stems_panel.py - Manages the stem visibility checkboxes.

### Utility Modules

- utils/settings.py - Handles loading and saving application settings.

### Component Interaction Overview
The components interact in a hierarchical manner:

- App Class (app.py)
   The central controller that maintains the application state and contains references to all UI components.
- UI Components
   Each UI component has a reference to the app instance, allowing them to:
   - Access shared variables (like stt, ent, etc.)
   - Call methods on other components via the app reference
   - Update the application state

### Making Independent Modifications
Here's how you can make changes to specific components without affecting others:

#### Modifying the Slider Component
The SliderView class is now completely separated, making it ideal for independent enhancement. For example, if you want to add new marker features or visualization options, you would:

1. Edit only ui/slider_view.py
2. Add new methods or modify existing ones within the SliderView class
3. Access app state through the self.app reference

#### Example Enhancement: Adding a Zoom Feature to the Slider
If you wanted to add a zoom feature to the slider component, you would modify slider_view.py to include zoom controls and adjust the marker visualization accordingly, without touching any other files.

### Adding New Features
To add entirely new features to the application:

- Create a new component - Add a new file in the appropriate directory (ui/ or utils/)
- Integrate it in app.py - Initialize it in the main app class
- Connect it to existing components - Use the app reference to access other components

### Separation of Concerns
Each module now has a specific responsibility:

- SliderView - Handles time navigation and marker visualization
- SongSelectionPanel - Manages song list and selection
- SectionControlPanel - Controls section editing and management
- PlaybackControlPanel - Manages playback parameters
- StemsPanel - Controls stem visibility
- SettingsManager - Handles persistence of application state

### Extending the Application
This modular structure makes it easy to extend the application with new features. For example:

1. Add a Visualizer Component - Create a new ui/visualizer.py module for waveform visualization
2. Add Keyboard Shortcuts - Create a utils/keyboard_shortcuts.py module
3. Add Recording Functionality - Create a ui/recorder.py module

### Testing Individual Components
With this modular structure, you can now more easily test individual components:

1. Create simple test scripts that initialize just one component
2. Mock the app interface for isolated testing
3. Test component boundaries and interactions

This refactoring positions your application for easier maintenance and enhancement moving forward, especially when you want to work on specific parts of the UI without affecting the core functionality.
